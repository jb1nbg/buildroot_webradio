      CAPS is a collection of audio plugins comprising virtual guitar
      amplification and a small range of basic classic effects, signal

      processors and generators of often elementary and occasionally
      exotic nature.

      The plugins aim to satisfy the highest demands in sound quality
      with maximal computational efficiency and zero latency.
